<ul>
    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments (called interventions) is evaluated within a group of study
        participants.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight
            the text that describes the intervention(s) of the study. You can highlight text in the sentence by
            clicking on a start and end word. If no information about the interventions is mentioned, mark the corresponding
            checkbox.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Interventions are:
        <ul>
            <li>a specific drug ("Aspirin")</li>
            <li>surgery ("inguinal hernia repair")</li>
            <li>talking therapy ("cognitive behavioural therapy")</li>
            <li>or even a lifestyle modification (diet change or change of the toothpaste the patients use)</li>
            <li>
                Many studies will have a group of patients who receive a "control" treatment, such as "placebo", no treatment at
                all, or the current standard practice ("usual care"). These should be also highlighted as interventions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Do not highlight:
        <ul>
            <li>details on how the interventions are given to the patients (e.g. "orally" or "intravenous")</li>
            <li>information about dosages (e.g. "325 mg")</li>
            <li>information about frequency or duration ("twice daily", "6 monthly sessions")</li>
            <li>intervention mentions without relevant information ("The drug was admistered" versus "The drug <strong class="annotation">Aspirin</strong> was admistered.")</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To give additional context, we show the study report in that the sentence appears. The report might be
        helpful, e.g., to identify that an
        abbreviation <i>RET</i> stands for <i>Regular Exercise Therapy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the sentence that you should highlight, we show 3 similar sentences as examples that are already highlighted by a
        medical expert. <strong>If one of these 3 examples is helpful to you in highlighting your sentence correctly, select
        the corresponding
        radio button.</strong> However, the similar examples might not be always helpful: They might contain text that is not highlighted
        but should be; and second, the example might not be similar to the sentence that you highlight.
