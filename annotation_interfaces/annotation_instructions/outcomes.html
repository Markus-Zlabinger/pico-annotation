<ul>
    <li>In medical studies, treatments are tested within a group of study
        participants. To determine if a new treatment works, various outcomes are measured in the people who take part
        in the
        study.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight
            the text that gives information about the outcomes of the study. You can highlight text in the sentence by
            clicking on a start and end word. If no information about the outcomes is mentioned, mark the corresponding
            checkbox.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Outcomes contain:
        <ul>
            <li>outcomes measured in patients ("blood pressure", "weight")</li>
            <li>outcomes regarding the intervention ("effectiveness", "safety", "costs")</li>
            <li>the score on a medical test or questionnaire ("Quality of Life Scales")</li>
            <li>positive or negative events in the patient groups ("quit smoking", "death", "pain reduction")</li>
            <li>adverse reactions ("Garlic lowers <strong class="annotation">blood pressure</strong>")</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not highlight:
        <ul>
            <li>numbers or results (e.g. "<s>10 patients</s> <strong class="annotation">quit smoking</strong>")</li>
            <li>interpretations of outcomes (e.g. "<strong class="annotation">quality of life</strong> <s>improved among
                patients</s>")
            </li>
            <li>outcome mentions without relevant information ("Various outcomes were measured." versus "Various outcomes (<strong
                    class="annotation">QoL, safety</strong>) were measured.")
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To give additional context, we show the study report in that the sentence appears. The report might be
        helpful, e.g., to identify that an
        abbreviation <i>QoL</i> stands for <i>Quality of Life</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the sentence that you should highlight, we show 3 similar sentences as examples that are already highlighted
        by a
        medical expert. <strong>If one of these 3 examples is helpful to you in highlighting your sentence correctly,
        select
        the corresponding
        radio button.</strong> However, the similar examples might not be always helpful: They might contain text that
        is not
        highlighted
        but should be; and second, the example might not be similar to the sentence that you highlight.
