    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments is evaluated within a group of study
        participants.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight
            the text that gives information about the participants of the study. You can highlight text in the sentence
            by
            clicking on a start and end word. If no information about the participants is mentioned, mark the
            corresponding
            checkbox.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Relevant information about participants include:
        <ul>
            <li>gender</li>
            <li>medical conditions (e.g. diseases, upcoming surgery)</li>
            <li>location ("patients in Taiwanese Hospitals")</li>
            <li>how many people were in the study</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not highlight:
        <ul>
            <li>participant mentions without relevant information ("Patients were divided into two groups." versus "<strong class="annotation">Patients with diabetes</strong> were divided into two groups.")</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To give additional context, we show the study report in that the sentence appears. The report might be
        helpful, e.g., to identify that an abbreviation <i>AD</i> stands for <i>Alzheimer Disease</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the sentence that you should highlight, we show 3 similar sentences as examples that are already highlighted
        by a
        medical expert. <strong>If one of these 3 examples is helpful to you in highlighting your sentence correctly,
        select
        the corresponding
        radio button.</strong> However, the similar examples might not be always helpful: They might contain text that
        is not highlighted
        but should be; and second, the example might not be similar to the sentence that you highlight.
