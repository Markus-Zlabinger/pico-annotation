"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span>Development of renal disease in people at high cardiovascular risk: results of the HOPE randomized study.<br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>In people with diabetes, renal disease tends to progress from microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria to renal insufficiency. Little evidence has been published for the nondiabetic population. <span class='window'>This study retrospectively analyzed changes of proteinuria over 4.5 yr in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation) study, which compared ramipril's effects to placebo in 9297 participants, including 3577 with diabetes and 1956 with microalbuminuria.</span> This report is restricted to 7674 participants with albuminuria data at baseline and at follow-up. Inclusion criteria were known vascular disease or diabetes plus one other cardiovascular risk factor, exclusion criteria included heart failure or known impaired left ventricular function, dipstick-positive proteinuria (&gt;1+), and serum creatinine &gt;2.3 mg&#x2F;dl (200 microM). Baseline microalbuminuria predicted subsequent clinical proteinuria for the study participants overall (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6 to 24.4), in participants without diabetes (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.6 to 32.4), and in participants with diabetes (OR, 18.2; 95% CI, 12.4 to 26.7). Any progression of albuminuria (defined as new microalbuminuria or new clinical proteinuria) occurred in 1859 participants; 1542 developed new microalbuminuria, and 317 participants developed clinical proteinuria. Ramipril reduced the risk for any progression (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; P &#x3D; 0.0146). People without and with diabetes who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease are also at risk for a progressive rise in albuminuria. Microalbuminuria itself predicts clinical proteinuria in nondiabetic and in diabetic people. Ramipril prevents or delays the progression of albuminuria.<br /><br />","This>>study>>retrospectively>>analyzed>>changes>>of>>proteinuria>>over>>4.5>>yr>>in>>the>>HOPE>>(>>Heart>>Outcomes>>and>>Prevention>>Evaluation>>)>>study>>,>>which>>compared>>ramipril>>'s>>effects>>to>>placebo>>in>>9297>>participants>>,>>including>>3577>>with>>diabetes>>and>>1956>>with>>microalbuminuria>>.",<span class=''>Why </span> <span class=''>were </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>results </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>Heart </span> <span class=''>Outcomes </span> <span class=''>Prevention </span> <span class=''>Evaluation </span> <span class=''>( </span> <span class=''>HOPE </span> <span class=''>) </span> <span class=''>trial </span> <span class=''>so </span> <span class=''>astounding </span> <span class=''>? </span>,"<span class=''>In </span> <span class=''>all </span> <span class=''>, </span> <span class=''>360 </span> <span class=''>diabetic </span> <span class=''>patients </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>coronary </span> <span class=''>artery </span> <span class=''>disease </span> <span class=''>were </span> <span class=''>treated </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class='participants'>pioglitazone </span> <span class=''>or </span> <span class='participants'>glimepiride </span> <span class=''>for </span> <span class=''>18 </span> <span class=''>months </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>PERISCOPE </span> <span class=''>( </span> <span class='participants'>Pioglitazone </span> <span class=''>Effect </span> <span class=''>on </span> <span class=''>Regression </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>Intravascular </span> <span class=''>Sonographic </span> <span class=''>Coronary </span> <span class=''>Obstruction </span> <span class=''>Prospective </span> <span class=''>Evaluation </span> <span class=''>) </span> <span class=''>study </span> <span class=''>. </span>",<span class=''>The </span> <span class=''>Heart </span> <span class=''>Outcomes </span> <span class=''>Prevention </span> <span class=''>Evaluation </span> <span class=''>( </span> <span class=''>HOPE </span> <span class=''>) </span> <span class=''>study </span> <span class=''>was </span> <span class=''>important </span> <span class=''>because </span> <span class=''>it </span> <span class=''>showed </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>benefits </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class='participants'>ramipril </span> <span class=''>- </span> <span class=''>an </span> <span class='participants'>angiotensin-converting </span> <span class='participants'>enzyme </span> <span class='participants'>( </span> <span class='participants'>ACE </span> <span class='participants'>) </span> <span class='participants'>inhibitor </span> <span class=''>- </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>patients </span> <span class=''>at </span> <span class=''>high </span> <span class=''>risk </span> <span class=''>for </span> <span class=''>cardiovascular </span> <span class=''>events </span> <span class=''>. </span>,11381289:0_3,21211686:4_2,11381289:1_1,"<ul>    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments (called interventions) is evaluated within a group of study        participants.    </li>    <li>        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight            the text that describes the intervention(s) of the study.

Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups. In patients with MDS or in the remission-induction phase of chemotherapy, the numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group, whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy. In patients with neutrophil counts of &gt;0.1 x 10(9)&#x2F;L lasting for more than 4 weeks, the frequency of infection in the fluconazole group (5 of 9 patients) was significantly higher than in the itraconazole group (0 of 7 patients; P &#x3D; .03).

Although an increasing number of group-based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described, randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy. To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group-based Program (SST-GP) and a Leisure Activities Group-based Program (LA-GP) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life (QoL) in young people with HFA. Eligible patients were children and adolescents with HFA. Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group. The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling (DANVA2) from baseline. After the 6-month training period, the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces, whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable. Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces. QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment, as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community. <span class='window'>The SST-GP had higher efficacy than the LA-GP.</span> Data justify replication using larger samples.<br /><br />",The>>SST-GP>>had>>higher>>efficacy>>than>>the>>LA-GP>>.,<span class=''>NTR2405 </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>Controlled-Trials.com </span> <span class=''>ISRCTN74757601 </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>No </span> <span class=''>other </span> <span class=''>symptom/QOL </span> <span class=''>domains </span> <span class=''>differed </span> <span class=''>significantly </span> <span class=''>. </span>,24989854:15_1,25479285:12_2,22956006:12_3,"<ul>    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments (called interventions) is evaluated within a group of study        participants.    </li>    <li>        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight            the text that describes the intervention(s) of the study.

"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span>A multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome: the Junior Detective Training Program.<br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.<br />METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n &#x3D; 26) or wait-list control (n &#x3D; 23) conditions.<br />RESULTS <span class='window'>Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures.</span> Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.<br />CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS.

"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span><span class='window'>Economic evaluation of aquatic exercise for persons with osteoarthritis.</span><br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective.<br />DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated using trial data. Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost&#x2F;QALY gained would not exceed $50,000.<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) and Current Health Desirability Rating (CHDR) were used for economic evaluation, supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL) collected at baseline and postclass. Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs. Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries&#x2F;questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs&#x2F;QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates.<br />RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal (QWB) or better (CHDR, HAQ, PQOL) health-related quality of life compared with controls. Outcomes improved with regular class attendance. Costs&#x2F;QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD.<br />CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise.<br /><br />",Economic>>evaluation>>of>>aquatic>>exercise>>for>>persons>>with>>osteoarthritis>>.,<span class=''>Cost-effectiveness </span> <span class=''>data </span> <span class=''>are </span> <span class=''>similarly </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>accord </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>giving </span> <span class=''>high </span> <span class=''>priority </span> <span class=''>to </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>treatment </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>older </span> <span class=''>individuals </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>hypertension </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>Subjective </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>objective </span> <span class=''>levels </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class='participants'>physical </span> <span class='participants'>activity </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>their </span> <span class=''>association </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>cardiorespiratory </span> <span class=''>fitness </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>rheumatoid </span> <span class=''>arthritis </span> <span class=''>patients </span> <span class=''>. </span>,"<span class=''>To </span> <span class=''>compare </span> <span class=''>, </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>post-acute </span> <span class=''>hemiparetic </span> <span class=''>patients </span> <span class=''>, </span> <span class=''>gait </span> <span class=''>improvement </span> <span class=''>after </span> <span class='participants'>conventional </span> <span class='participants'>physical </span> <span class='participants'>therapy </span> <span class='participants'>alone </span> <span class=''>or </span> <span class='participants'>with </span> <span class='participants'>a </span> <span class='participants'>specialised </span> <span class='participants'>balance </span> <span class='participants'>retraining </span> <span class='participants'>program </span> <span class=''>. </span>",7827398:6_2,25885649:0_1,15848261:1_3,"<ul>    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments (called interventions) is evaluated within a group of study        participants.    </li>    <li>        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight            the text that describes the intervention(s) of the study.
