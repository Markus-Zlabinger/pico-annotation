"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span><span class='window'>A multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome: the Junior Detective Training Program.</span><br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.<br />METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n &#x3D; 26) or wait-list control (n &#x3D; 23) conditions.<br />RESULTS Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.<br />CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.<br /><br />",A>>multi-component>>social>>skills>>intervention>>for>>children>>with>>Asperger>>syndrome>>:>>the>>Junior>>Detective>>Training>>Program>>.,<span class=''>Teaching </span> <span class=''>emotion </span> <span class=''>recognition </span> <span class=''>skills </span> <span class=''>to </span> <span class='participants'>young </span> <span class='participants'>children </span> <span class='participants'>with </span> <span class='participants'>autism </span> <span class=''>: </span> <span class=''>a </span> <span class=''>randomised </span> <span class=''>controlled </span> <span class=''>trial </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>an </span> <span class=''>emotion </span> <span class=''>training </span> <span class=''>programme </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>Social </span> <span class=''>skills </span> <span class=''>training </span> <span class=''>( </span> <span class=''>SST </span> <span class=''>) </span> <span class=''>is </span> <span class=''>a </span> <span class=''>common </span> <span class=''>intervention </span> <span class=''>for </span> <span class='participants'>children </span> <span class='participants'>with </span> <span class='participants'>autism </span> <span class='participants'>spectrum </span> <span class='participants'>disorders </span> <span class='participants'>( </span> <span class='participants'>ASDs </span> <span class='participants'>) </span> <span class=''>to </span> <span class=''>improve </span> <span class=''>their </span> <span class=''>social </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>communication </span> <span class=''>skills </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>A </span> <span class=''>randomized </span> <span class=''>controlled </span> <span class=''>study </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>a </span> <span class=''>social </span> <span class=''>skills </span> <span class=''>training </span> <span class=''>for </span> <span class='participants'>preadolescent </span> <span class='participants'>children </span> <span class='participants'>with </span> <span class='participants'>autism </span> <span class='participants'>spectrum </span> <span class='participants'>disorders </span> <span class=''>: </span> <span class=''>generalization </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>skills </span> <span class=''>by </span> <span class=''>training </span> <span class=''>parents </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>teachers </span> <span class=''>? </span>,22881991:0_3,24989854:1_1,24989854:0_2,"<ul>    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments is evaluated within a group of study        participants.    </li>    <li>        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight            the text that gives information about the participants of the study.

Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups. In patients with MDS or in the remission-induction phase of chemotherapy, the numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group, whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy. In patients with neutrophil counts of &gt;0.1 x 10(9)&#x2F;L lasting for more than 4 weeks, the frequency of infection in the fluconazole group (5 of 9 patients) was significantly higher than in the itraconazole group (0 of 7 patients; P &#x3D; .03).

"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span>Assessment of acute bronchodilator effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients.<br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>BACKGROUND In COPD patients, reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s (ΔFEV1) and forced vital capacity (ΔFVC). By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone, bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation, gas trapping, and possibly dyspnea at rest. Hence, we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes (ΔsRAW) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators.<br />METHODS On two days, 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation (VAS score) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300μg indacaterol administration.<br />RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients, respectively. <span class='window'>ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume (ΔITGV) (r=0.61;

"<span class='studyheader'>Title: </span><span class='window'>Economic evaluation of aquatic exercise for persons with osteoarthritis.</span><br /><br /><span class='studyheader'>Abstract: </span>OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective.<br />DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated using trial data. Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost&#x2F;QALY gained would not exceed $50,000.<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) and Current Health Desirability Rating (CHDR) were used for economic evaluation, supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL) collected at baseline and postclass. Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs. Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries&#x2F;questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs&#x2F;QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates.<br />RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal (QWB) or better (CHDR, HAQ, PQOL) health-related quality of life compared with controls. Outcomes improved with regular class attendance. Costs&#x2F;QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD.<br />CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise.<br /><br />",Economic>>evaluation>>of>>aquatic>>exercise>>for>>persons>>with>>osteoarthritis>>.,"<span class=''>To </span> <span class=''>compare </span> <span class=''>, </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class='participants'>post-acute </span> <span class='participants'>hemiparetic </span> <span class='participants'>patients </span> <span class=''>, </span> <span class=''>gait </span> <span class=''>improvement </span> <span class=''>after </span> <span class=''>conventional </span> <span class=''>physical </span> <span class=''>therapy </span> <span class=''>alone </span> <span class=''>or </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>a </span> <span class=''>specialised </span> <span class=''>balance </span> <span class=''>retraining </span> <span class=''>program </span> <span class=''>. </span>",<span class=''>Subjective </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>objective </span> <span class=''>levels </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class=''>physical </span> <span class=''>activity </span> <span class=''>and </span> <span class=''>their </span> <span class=''>association </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>cardiorespiratory </span> <span class=''>fitness </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class='participants'>rheumatoid </span> <span class='participants'>arthritis </span> <span class='participants'>patients </span> <span class=''>. </span>,<span class=''>Cost-effectiveness </span> <span class=''>data </span> <span class=''>are </span> <span class=''>similarly </span> <span class=''>in </span> <span class=''>accord </span> <span class=''>with </span> <span class=''>giving </span> <span class=''>high </span> <span class=''>priority </span> <span class=''>to </span> <span class=''>the </span> <span class=''>treatment </span> <span class=''>of </span> <span class='participants'>older </span> <span class='participants'>individuals </span> <span class='participants'>with </span> <span class='participants'>hypertension </span> <span class=''>. </span>,15848261:1_3,25885649:0_1,7827398:6_2,"<ul>    <li>In medical studies, the efficacy of medical treatments is evaluated within a group of study        participants.    </li>    <li>        <strong>We present to you a sentence of a study report in which your task is to highlight            the text that gives information about the participants of the study.
